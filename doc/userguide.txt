This is the user guide for the "Booking agent" application. The application
supports client service representatives to manage bookings for home improvement 
contractors ("subcontractors") which offer home improvement services.

1. Application startup

1.1 Launch the application
======================
The application can be launched in three modes. The mode depends on the
specified program argument. The command
  java -jar runme.jar [mode]
launches the application. The mode argument can be:
alone:   application launched in standalone mode
server:  application launched in server mode
<empty>: application launched in network client mode
Please note: No other arguments (more or different ones) are valid. The program
is directly terminated when started with invalid arguments.


1.2 Program parameter input
===========================
Each time the application is launched, you are asked to specify one or two mode
dependent program arguments:
 - the network port to be used for server/client communication (server, client)
 - the database file to be used by the server (server, standalone)
 - the server IP address or hostname (client)
If the input is aborted, the application is directly terminated.
You will get noticed if your input was invalid and you can enter another value
or cancel the input (what causes the application's termination - as said).
To ease up this process, the input is always initialized with the last used
values so that just a few clicks are needed to go through this configuration
part when using recent parameters.
Please note: If the application is started the first time, the properties file
is not available. Therefore it is created and initialized with standard values
where reasonable. For example the standard RMI port 1099 will be predefined in
the newly created properties file.


1.3 Program parameters
======================
Depending on the the program mode you are asked to specify different parameters
at the application's startup.
Here is a short overview of the arguments the different modes require:
 - standalone mode: database file
 - server mode:     network port and database file
 - client mode:     server address and network port
The database file is choosen from a file chooser dialog which is automatically
pre-filtered for *.db files. It shows the content of the directory containing
the last choosen database file (if available). If no database file is available,
the file chooser is initialized with an operating system dependent standard 
directory. 
The network port is specified via a simple input dialog. You can choose any 
number between 1024 and 65535. The system ports (0 to 1023) are not foreseen for
usage because there are not available on all operating systems for all users. It
is recommended to use the standard port 1099 for convenience reasons.
The server address can be the IP address or the hostname of the computer the
server is supposed to run on.
The server address and the server port can be obtained from the server's log and
may be communicated to the users who need to connect to the server.
If the program parameter input was successful the program is launched in the
chosen mode and the properties file is updated with the specified parameters. 


2. Server mode
==============
The server mode runs without a graphical interface. The only thing visible to 
you is the console window containing the log. if you wish to stop the server,
type CTRL+C on the console. 
If you need to switch the port or database file, terminate and restart the 
server with the desired configuration or start a second instance using a
different port.


3. Using the GUI (client and standalone mode)

3.1 General
===========
The client and standalone mode use the same GUI (graphical user interface) to
take and execute your commands. There is only one little difference existing
in the file menu (see 3.4).
Via this GUI you can search for subcontractors and book or unbook them and you
can change the data source. To make the GUI intuitively usable, it supports
common key shortcuts an behaviors (please see the following sections for more
detail).
Plase note: Buttons are only active (i.e.: available for pushing) if their use 
makes sense. For example, the book button is disabled if the subcontractor is 
already booked.
The GUI can be exited via the standard cross button on the upper right of the
window bar or via the menu: 'File' -> 'Exit'.


3.2 Searching for subcontractors
================================
You can search for subcontractors using the search area on the upper left.
With the available input options in this area you can search for
 - just name
 - just location
 - name AND location
 - name OR location
of a subcontractor. The search is context sensitive and matches all
subcontractors having exactly the values you specified in the text fields. If
both fields are left blank, all subcontractors are retrieved from the database.
Single blank fields are ignored, that means: AND or OR is only applicable if
both fields are filled.
Right after the program started all subcontractors from the database are
displayed by default.
The search result can be sorted by each column. Just click on the header of the
column you want to sort. Clicking the header again, changes the sorting order
(ascending, descending).
Please note: The table's column sorting stays active until you choose a new
datasource.


3.3 The booking of a subcontractor
==================================
After the search has been executed, you can see the result in the table. Select
a subcontractor via a single mouse click. If the subcontractor is free for
booking, you can book it, otherwise you can only clear the booking. To execute
the booking / clear booking push the appropriate button on the upper right.
If needed, you can have a look at the subcontractors detail in a more
comfortable way. Double-clicking a table entry, pressing return or pushing the 
"Show detail" button opens the detail dialog for the selected subcontractor.
From this dialog you can also book or unbook the subcontractor. After the 
booking / unbooking the result table is updated.


3.4 Additional notes about the booking in the client mode
=========================================================
Changes made by other CSRs working on the same server are not visible until you
refresh the table or start a new search. It is recommended to refresh the table
periodically when in client mode to be sure to work on up-to-date data. The more 
users are connected to the server, the more often a refresh is useful. Only
needed in client mode, the refresh button is not visible in standalone mode. 
If you try to book a subcontractor which has already been booked by another CSR 
(since the last update of your table), you will get an error message indicating 
that this subcontractor is not bookable. In this case, please search for another
subcontractor for your client.
If you try to clear the booking of a subcontractor, it may be possible that
another CSR already cleared the booking and booked it for another customer. In
this case the system will show you a message indicating that the subcontractor's
booking changed.  


3.5 Changing the data source
============================ 
You can change the data source using the 'File' menu. Depending on the program 
mode it has a particular entry:
 - standalone mode: 'Choose database file' (datasoruce is a database file)
 - clienbt mode:    'Input server and port' (datasource is a server connection)
Click the menu entry and you will get the dialog known from the program start. 
Select the new datasource. If your input is valid, the new datasource is used 
from now on and the properties file is updated. If not, your are asked to input
again. If you cancel the input the old datasource stays active.


3.6 Information text fields
===========================
The GUI contains two information text fields: The connection info text field on
the upper right and the status info text field at the bottom. Their names
indicate their purpose: The connection info text field shows you the server name
and port or the database file you are connected to. The status info text field
is something like a rudimentary log and provides feedback about the just
executed action. For example: how many subcontractors where found or if the
data source change was successful.
 

4. Troubleshooting

4.1 General
===========
All errors are written to the application-log. Unexpected exceptions are logged 
in full detail, others in a shortened way. Thus, it is always visible, what 
happened during program use and the log of unexpected errors might help resolve 
the problem.


4.2 Networked client does not start
===================================
If you are unable to start the networked client, please check if:
 - the specified host/port is correct
 - a firewall on the server's host filters incoming connections
 - a firewall on the client filters outgoing connections
 - the server's hostname (if used) is resolved to the correct ip-address
